Personal Profile 
----------------
I am a Data Analytics postgraduate student at the University of Sheffield. For my undergraduate degree I studied Mathematics at the Univeristy of Leeds.

My Goals 
---------
This is a website that I have created and it is still a work in progress.
I aim to develop this website to:

* Include my CV
* Keep a track of any projects I undertake
* Start a blog on Mathematicians (hopefully improving my writting skills)
* Gain some GitHub skills
