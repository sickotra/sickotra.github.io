# Srinivasa Ramanujan & Partitions

Ramanujan was an extraordinary mathematician born in Erode, India in 1887 (Ramanujan Aiyangar et al., 1995). His work was very broad but focused mainly on the pure mathematics of number theory, including but not limited to the partitions of numbers, continued fractions, elliptic functions, Reimann series and the infinite series. Each of his discoveries were just as special, but an interesting discovery was his one of partitions.

I was introduced to the concept of partitions in my third year module ‘Combinatorics’ (Pillay & Parker, 2020).  The formal definition for a partition is, 
> Let _n_ be an integer \ge 0. By a _partition_ of the number _n_ we mean a representation of _n_ as a sum of positive integers, where the order does not matter (and repetition is allowed).
(Pillay & Parker, 2020)

So essentially a partition is the way in which a positive integer can be broken down into other positive integers that add up to that original integer. For example,

The number 4 has five partitions (Aron, 2011; Pillay & Parker, 2020):

| Partition No. | Notation 1     | Notation 2    |
| ------------- |:--------------:| :------------:|
| 1             | 4              | (4)           |
| 2             | 3 + 1          | (3, 1)        |
| 3             | 2 + 2          | (2, 2)        |
| 4             | 2 + 1 + 1      | (2, 1, 1)     |
| 5             | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  | (1, 1, 1, 1)  |
