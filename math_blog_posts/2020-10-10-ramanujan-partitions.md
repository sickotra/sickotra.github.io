## Srinivasa Ramanujan & Partitions
![Ramanujan Quote](https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-an-equation-means-nothing-to-me-unless-it-expresses-a-thought-of-god-srinivasa-ramanujan-57-27-22.jpg)

  Ramanujan was an extraordinary mathematician born in Erode, India in 1887 (Ramanujan Aiyangar et al., 1995). His work was very broad but focused mainly on the pure mathematics of number theory, including but not limited to the partitions of numbers, continued fractions, elliptic functions, Reimann series and the infinite series. Each of his discoveries were just as special, but an interesting discovery was his one of partitions. I was introduced to the concept of partitions in my third year module ‘Combinatorics’ (Pillay & Parker, 2020). The formal definition for a partition is, 
  
> Let _n_ be an integer &ge; 0. By a _partition_ of the number _n_ we mean a representation of _n_ as a sum of positive integers, where the order does not matter (and repetition is allowed).

(Pillay & Parker, 2020)

  So essentially a partition is the way in which a positive integer can be broken down into other positive integers that add up to that original integer. For example, the number 4 has five partitions (Aron, 2011; Pillay & Parker, 2020):

| Partition No. | Notation 1     | Notation 2    |
|:------------- |:---------------| :------------ |
| 1             | 4              | (4)           |
| 2             | 3 + 1          | (3, 1)        |
| 3             | 2 + 2          | (2, 2)        |
| 4             | 2 + 1 + 1      | (2, 1, 1)     |
| 5             | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  | (1, 1, 1, 1)  |

   _Table 1: The five partitions of 4 shown in two different notations._ 

  It is easy to see that all 5 sums have positive integers that add up to 4. The convention to list the parts in decreasing order has been used. The real magic happens when we question why there are 5 ‘parts’ (aka the length of the partition) for the number 4? How does the number of parts relate to the integer in question? What about the relationship between partitions and the partitions of _sets_ of size n? (Pillay & Parker, 2020) . Ramanujan also discovered patterns for these partitions. He found that for any number that ended in 4 or 9, had a number of parts divisible by 5 (Aron, 2011). 

  I was intrigued by Ramanujan’s work mentioned in the lecture notes and came across the film ‘The Man Who Knew Infinity (2015)’ based of the book by Kanigel (1991), which told the captivating story of Ramanujan’s life. His mathematical talents developed at a young age from almost purely self-teaching and hardly any official training. He developed his research alone in India and he had attempted numerous times to get his work recognised, but his ideas were disregarded. No mathematician could grasp his novel concepts and believe his work – Ramanujan was supposedly ‘anti-proofs’ or was not aware of their need (much like the majority of maths undergrads and our despise of learning lengthy proofs, but imagine having to build them from scratch!) and so his theories at the time did not have the rigorous proofing to convince any mathematician who showed a slight interest (Kanigel, 1991).

  However, everything changed in 1913 which marked the beginning of Ramanujan’s journey from working as a clerk in Madras (Ramanujan Aiyangar et al., 1995) to one of the greatest Indian mathematicians to have lived. Through writing letters, his work sparked the interest of the British mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge. He was invited to Trinity College the following year with Hardy acting as his tutor to guide him and to find proofs for his theorems. Hardy was just as surprised by the incredibly exceptional mathematics in Ramanujan’s notebooks – a lot of the ideas completely new and others which had just recently been proved. It is important to remember that Ramanujan had no formal academic teaching and no idea about any recent mathematical developments so absolutely all his work presented so far was beyond remarkable. For his discoveries he was awarded with a fellowship of Trinity College and a fellowship of the Royal Society (Ramanujan Aiyangar et al., 1995).

  Ramanujan died in 1920 from ongoing health issues, aged only 32 (Ramanujan Aiyangar et al., 1995). In these brief years he was able to revolutionise fields of pure mathematics, which only years later would be recognised as widely as they should have when he was alive. He left behind his notebooks and publishing’s as well as unpublished work that has been studied and verified for years after his death. His discoveries led to mathematicians and scientists researching further and finding applications of partitions in fields such as cryptography, molecular chemistry and particle physics (Tran et al., 2004) - not just combinatorics. There was a Ramanujan journal created in in 1997 dedicated to the mathematics Ramanujan impacted, such as his work on partitions (Hirschhorn & Sellers, 2020).  His theorems are still used as a source to inspire new research in mathematics, and of course some of which are taught to students like myself!
